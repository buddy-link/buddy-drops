# Buddy-Drops Example

This is a quick example of how you might use the Buddy Drops SDK to implement a raffle mint on Solana.

## How to use

### Clone the repository
To close the rope you will want to run this command:

`git clone git@github.com:buddy-link/buddy-drops.git`

### Get Started

You will want to install the dependencies with

`bun install` or `yarn` or `npm install`

### Develop

You will want to run this command to see a preview on localhost:3000

`bun run dev`

## Important Files

There are only 2 important files to look at:

`/src/app/layout.jsx`

and 

`/src/app/(home)/Home.jsx`

With these two files you'll be able to see the example code and how to implement it.

For now it is running with mock local enabled, but we will soon add the connections to 
the smart-contract as well as the backend with api-keys.
